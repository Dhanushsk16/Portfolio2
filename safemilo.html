      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <div class="problem">
      <img src="/problem 1.png" alt="">
      <p>Scams targeting seniors are increasing, and most tools are either too complex or only block threats. Seniors need a solution that both protects and educates them in a simple, accessible, and trustworthy way.</p>

      <section id="research">
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>A combination of  primary and secondary research was conducted to understand how seniors dealt with scams and guage their comfort level with mobile apps</p>
        <h3>Secondary research - Competitor Analysis</h3>
        <img src="/Slide 07.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Current scam protection apps focus mainly on detection and filtering. Most tools are not made for seniors and miss out on user education, real-time alerts, and accessibility support.</p>
        <h3>Desk Research</h3>
        <p>Some commonly used apps by seniors were studied to understand the UI patterns that would seem familiar to them.</p>
        <img src="/desk_research 1.png" alt="">
        <h3>Primary research - User Interviews & Personas</h3>
        <p><strong>Research Objective:</strong> To understand the challenges seniors face in recognizing and responding to scams, to identify design patterns, content formats, and support features that would make a mobile app intuitive, accessible, and helpful for scam prevention and education.</p>
        <p>Two groups of users were interviewed. Seniors (60+) and adults (18-60)</p>

            <div class="card">
              <b>Unreliable information sources:</b>
             Seniors often rely on forwarded messages for scam news, which are rarely verified and can spread fear or misinformation.

              <b>Tech dependence:</b>

        <h2>Branding and UI</h2>
        <p>One of our biggest design challenges was trying to make technology seem friendly to seniors. Therefore, we decided to have a Mascot - Milo the fox- who would add warmth and friendliness to the application.</p>
        <img src="/Slide 05.jpg" alt="">
        <img src="/UI kit branding.jpg" alt="">
        <p>SafeMilo’s UI and branding had to strike a balance between seeming warm and friendly vs appearing protective and reliable, since it was after a scam protection app at the end of the day. Therefore, the color palette includes Milo Orange for warmth and a deep navy blue for trust. Custom illustrations were designed to make the application</p>
        <img src="/Slide 18.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The SafeMilo’s UI kit was designed specifically with seniors in mind with large button sizes, spacious cards and easy to read text. The UI kit was well documented with clear usage instructions. </p>

      <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>SafeMilo isn’t just a scam-protection tool , it’s a digital companion designed to empower seniors. <br>

          This project challenged many assumptions I had about accessible design. With limited time for primary research, I had to rely heavily on established user patterns and reference apps already popular with seniors. This approach taught me the value of informed decision-making when constraints are tight. <br>

          As the design lead, I embraced an agile mindset, iterating quickly, learning from early missteps, and helping the team pivot when our initial low-fidelity designs didn’t quite land. Failing fast became a strength, not a setback. <br>

          The result was a functional and thoughtfully crafted design. While further testing will reveal areas for improvement, this project affirmed something important: accessible design isn’t a niche, it’s the future of good UX.
