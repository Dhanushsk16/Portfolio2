                In the UX design phase, I designed the information architecture for the entire platform followed by the user flow for the overview, budget and collaborators sections. In the UI design phase, I created the brand color palette. Additionally, I worked on the Overview and Collaborators pages. I was also in charge of all the custom illustrations developed for the platform.

      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <img src="/02 Problem.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Event planning is fragmented and stressful, often requiring multiple apps to manage budgets, guests, and vendors. Finding trusted vendors is also difficult, with many relying on word-of-mouth or unreliable online reviews.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="research">
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>Primary and secondary research was conducted to understand how users plan events, identify pain points, and uncover opportunities to streamline the process through an all-in-one platform.</p>
        <h3>Secondary research - Competitor Analysis</h3>
        <img src="/05 competitor analysis 1.png" alt="">
        <p>It was observed that the online event planning space was either mainly focused on weddings or large scale events involving ticket sales. There were simply not enough platforms catering to the need of personal event planning.</p>
        <h3>Primary research - User Interviews & Personas</h3>
        <p>Two groups of users were interviewed.</p>

        <h2>Wireframes and Testing</h2>
        <p>We conducted user testing with our mid-fidelity wireframes where one of the most severe issues noticed was that keeping the side navigation close by default was affecting the discoverability of the features. So in the next version we decide to eliminate the collapsible menu and decided to keep it open at all times.</p>

        <h3>Event Creation</h3>
        <p>The event creation process is made highly intuitive and engaging for new users</p>
        <img src="/Group 1000006068.jpg" alt="">

        <h3>Event Overview</h3>
        <p>This page gives users a quick glimpse of all the major aspects of their event. Additionally, every user gets a task list based on the event type they selected during the event creation process so they don’t have to start form scratch.</p>
        <img src="/Group 1000006069.jpg" alt="">

        <h3>Vendors</h3>
        <p>Users can browse through hundreds of vendors and find their best match.</p>
        <img src="/Group 1000006070.jpg" alt="">

        <h3>Budget tracking</h3>
        <p>Users can track their budget with ease as most of it is automated. When the user books a vendor the price of that booking is added to the budget.</p>
        <img src="/Group 1000006071.jpg" alt="">

        <h3>Collaborators & Guest lists</h3>
        <p>ToGathr makes event planning smarter and more collaborative by automating budget tracking and enabling teamwork. As users book vendors, costs are automatically added to their budget, giving them real-time insights. They can also invite friends, family, or colleagues to join the planning process and assign tasks, making collaboration seamless and organized.</p>

      <section id="branding">
        <h2>Branding, Design Systsem and Hand-off</h2>
        <p>ToGathr’s branding is warm, modern, and approachable, reflecting the joy and connection at the heart of every event. The visual identity uses clean layouts, soft yet vibrant colors, and playful illustrations to make planning feel less like a chore and more like part of the celebration. It's designed to build trust, reduce stress, and invite collaboration, whether the user is organizing a small gathering or a large-scale event.</p>

        <img src="/14 UI kit components.jpg" alt="">
        <img src="/Section 1 1.png" alt="">
        <p>To ensure smooth front-end implementation, we built a centralized design library where developers can easily reference all UI elements, including components, color styles, and card layouts that are used throughout the platform.
        And during the hand-off phase, all the screens were annotated to ensure a smooth handover to the development team.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>ToGathr addresses real pain points in event planning by centralizing critical tasks into one responsive, user-friendly platform. Through iterative design, deep user research, and thoughtful collaboration between designers and developers, we built a tool that brings structure to chaos. <br>

        The most important learning for me through this project was the importance of prioritization. As a team we underestimated the effort it would take to design and develop so many features within a set time period of 12 weeks. I think that a more focused approach with reduced features would have helped us achieve better refinement.
