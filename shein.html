        <p>Redesigning the well known fast fashion e-commerce app Shein to enhance it’s usability. On research, it was found that the app’s major problems are it’s cluttered interface and disorganized product categories. The updated UX of the app includes a structured system of applying sale banners and discounts. Additionally, product categories are simplified, making it easier to find products and reducing distractions during the shopping process.</p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>Shein is an e-commerce app with one of the largest number of users across the world (88 million as of 2023).  The is app is all    about fast fashion and getting the best deals and adds about 2000 new products on the app everyday.
        In an attempt to showcase all its new products and exciting discounts the app overwhelms the users with too much information and an increased cognitive load every time they visit the app.</p>
      <h3>Secondary research to understand the user</h3>
      <p>Online reviews often reveal users' frustrations and clearly highlight their pain points.</p>

      <ol class="redisgnList">
        <div>
        <li><strong>Categories Simplified</strong>
          <ul>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Product feed is no longer random</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Products are displayed as a carousel under relevant labels such as Top-deals, Discounts and recommendations. There are no longer any extra tabs that the user has to click on to view categorized content.</li>

        <li><strong>The top nav bar is simplified</strong>

      <ul>
        <li>Images in sub-categories are distracting, and filters are repeated unnecessarily. External filters clutter the page, drawing attention away from products.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The redesign reduces cognitive overload and makes products more discoverable by removing redundant UI. It addresses the users concerns by simplifying the size selection feature and making the product selection flow distraction free and efficient. This redesign also ensures that Shein can actually feature all their products without making their app feel cluttered. The use of progressive disclosure in the redesign helps users find what they want without any confusion. </p>
